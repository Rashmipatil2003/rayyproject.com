    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is the heart of the entire web. Whatever content we see online is based on HTML. If you simply right-click on any web page and click on View Source, you will be able to see loads of tags, the first one being <html> which means the document is an HTML file.<br>

            <p> 
                The survey form is one of the most straightforward HTML projects you can start. In this project, we will create a simple survey form and then submit the information captured. You can open any text editor to write your code, and save your file with .html extension. For example, survey.html<br>
                You will learn about basic input tags, form creation, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.<br> 
                Here is the source code for the project with the necessary explanations of the tags. You can add elements one by one to see how they work.<br>
                Every file should start with the 
                &lt;html&gt;tag and end with 
                &lt;&Backslash;html&gt; end tag<br>
            </p>
            <th>Here is how your page will look like:</th>
